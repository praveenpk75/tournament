    <p>Certainly! Here's a paragraph about Free Fire tournaments:

        Garena Free Fire, a popular battle royale game, hosts various esports tournaments where players from around the world compete for glory and prizes. One of the leading platforms for Free Fire esports tournaments is **Challengermode**¬π. Players can participate in quality tournaments organized by the best organizers or even create their own spaces to monetize their communities.
        
        The pinnacle of Free Fire competitive play is the **Free Fire World Series (FFWS)**. In the 2022 edition, held in Sentosa, Singapore, 22 teams from 13 regions battled it out for supremacy. The FFWS uses the Squad Battle Royale mode, where 48 players (12 teams with four players each) parachute onto an island without any weapons or armor. Once on the ground, they scavenge for gear, including weapons, armor, and med kits, while eliminating opponents to secure victory¬≤¬≥.
        
        Moreover, Garena recently announced its participation in the **Esports World Cup (EWC)**, a Saudi Arabian government-backed event. The EWC features a whopping $1 million Free Fire tournament, scheduled to take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. From July 10th to 14th, 18 teams will compete for a share of the prize pool and a chance to qualify for the 2024 Free Fire World Series Global Finals‚Å¥.

Each character can equip 4 skills including the character's skill and 3 skills from other characters (one active skill and three passive skills can be equipped by a single character). Free Fire characters have unique backstories. A few of these characters were inspired by real-life celebrities whom Free Fire had collaborations with, such as Chrono from the collaboration with Cristiano Ronaldo, Dimitri & Thiva from the collaboration with Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, A-Patroa from the collaboration with Anitta, Alok from the collaboration with DJ Alok and JBeibs from the collaboration with Justin Bieber.
